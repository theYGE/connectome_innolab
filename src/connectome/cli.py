"""
Command line interface for :mod:`connectome`.

Why does this file exist, and why not put this in ``__main__``? You might be tempted to import things from ``__main__``
later, but that will cause problems--the code will get executed twice:
- When you run ``python3 -m connectome`` python will execute``__main__.py`` as a script.
  That means there won't be any ``connectome.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
- When you import __main__ it will get executed again (as a module) because
  there's no ``connectome.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
